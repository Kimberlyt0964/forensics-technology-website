         <h1> The New technology of The Forensic science field </h1> 
         

         <p>Technology has become a very important part of our lives and also for the forensic science field. New tools and ideas are being introduced everyday to solve crimes. By science and technology working together , we are able to  analyze evidence, fingerprinting or DNA identification, analysing drugs or chemicals, and dealing with body fluids. Science combined with various technologies to find evidence and solve cases. There are many different technologies used in the forensic sciences that most people don’t know exist. This is a reason why we should learn and better understand the importance of technology and it works with other fields</p>

        <p>Forensic scientists new to the field have much to look forward to in the coming years. Because technology is changing quickly, forensic science must focus on technology itself as evidence by uncovering cybercrime and other digital evidence (such as recovering evidence from cell phones, iPads, and computers). Over the years, scientists have had to shift their focus from old technologies — such as typewriters — to new technologies</p>
