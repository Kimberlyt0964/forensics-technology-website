         <h1> The New technology of The Forensic science field </h1> 
         

         <p>Technology has become a very important part of our lives and also for the forensic science field. New tools and ideas are being introduced everyday to solve crimes. By science and technology working together , we are able to  analyze evidence, fingerprinting or DNA identification, analysing drugs or chemicals, and dealing with body fluids. Science combined with various technologies to find evidence and solve cases. There are many different technologies used in the forensic sciences that most people don’t know exist. This is a reason why we should learn and better understand the importance of technology and it works with other fields</p>

        <p>Forensic scientists new to the field have much to look forward to in the coming years. Because technology is changing quickly, forensic science must focus on technology itself as evidence by uncovering cybercrime and other digital evidence (such as recovering evidence from cell phones, iPads, and computers). Over the years, scientists have had to shift their focus from old technologies — such as typewriters — to new technologies</p>

</ol>
    <ul> 
    <li>Using ultraviolet light can uncover a lot of information that may not be seen in visible light.</li>
    <li>We look at using ultraviolet light to enhance bruises and bite marks, and search for trace evidence.</li>
    <li>Phenom GSR Perception software is highly intuitive and allows the user to analyse multiple samples automatically.Photography is used to enhance difficult to see blood on dark and patterned clothing, and tattoos post-mortem difficult to see due to decomposition, lividity and burning.</li>

<li>DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE FOR GAMING EQUIPMENT</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>Criminals sometimes hide data on an Xbox in the hope that a gaming console won’t be seen as a likely evidence target. 
    <li>With an XFT Device once the Xbox file system is mounted, an analyst can browse the directory tree, list its contents, open and view files

 <ol> 
 <li>FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION</li>
   <ul>
    <li>Facial reconstruction is a method used in the forensic field when a crime involves unidentified remains. </li>
    <li>The process recreates the face of an individual from their skeletal remains through a combination of artistry, anthropology, osteology and anatomy.</li>
    <li>There are three main types of facial reconstruction: two-dimensional (photographic prints or drawing), three-dimensional (sculpture or high-res 3D computer image) and superimposition.</li>

<ol>
<li>DNA SEQUENCING </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>DNA is used to identify both criminals and victims by using trace evidence, such as hair or skin.</li>
    <li>DNA profiling has become the gold standard in forensic science since the first case more than 30 years ago. It is easier to use DNA today than before due the increase of technology we use today. </li>

    <li>AUTOMATED FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
    <li>Fingerprint identification allows forensic scientists to compare fingerprints found to an extensive digital database. </li>
     <li>Since fingerprint identification first emerged in the 1980s, automated fingerprint identification systems (AFIS) have become central to the work of police and other law enforcement agencies around the world.</li>

<ol>
    <li>LINK ANALYSIS SOFTWARE</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
    <li>Link analysis is a data analysis method in the network theory that examines the connections or relationships between the network nodes. </li>
    <li>The connection or relationship can be between any type of node or object like people, organisations, and transactions.</li>
    <li>It’s mostly used by financial institutions like banks and insurance and cyber security agencies to uncover criminal networks.</li>
    <li>In the same way, government agencies perform link analysis to investigate frauds, improve screening processes, investigate criminal activities, and expose the terrorist network.</li>

<ol>
    <li>DRUG TESTING</li>
</ol> 
<ul>
    <li>Presumptive tests (such as color tests) give only an indication of which type of substance is present -- but they can't specifically identify the substance(it can be in powder, liquid or pill form.)</li>

<ol>
    <li>FIRE TECHNOLOGY</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>For a fire to occur, three vital components must be present: a fuel source, an oxidant (O2) and a sufficient amount of energy in the form of heat. </li>
    <li>The primary purposes of a fire investigation is to establish the origin of the fire, determine the likely cause, and conclude whether the incident was accidental, natural or deliberate.</li>

<ol>
    <li>HIGH-POWERED MICROSCOPES</li>
</ol>
  <ul>  
    <li>Much evidence collected at crime scenes isn’t easily identified or analysed by the naked eye, and article size and shape are important metrics for forensics.</li>

<ol>
    <li>HIGH-SPEED BALLISTICS PHOTOGRAPHY</li>
</ol>
    <li>Ballistics photography involves taking pictures of bullets being fired from a gun or bullets penetrating their respective targets.</li>
    
    <li>The techniques involved in taking ballistic related photos are similar to those used for any other subject of high-speed photography, such as pictures of splashing liquids or a balloon popping.</li>
